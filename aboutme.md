There is no real way around it, I'm a _nerd_. I like science fiction, I like fantasy and I've been around computers my whole life. I use Linux for my own personal computers, not only for work, and I enjoy it!

I like movies, specially **going** to the movies and I read **a lot**. I also like PC games, although I don't have as much time to play as I used to. I added some movies/tv-shows/books/pc-games recommendations to this page so that you can get a sense of what I like! I tried to keep each category short (5 items) but could not keep the number for books... sorry

I also enjoy boardgames and play chess regularly (Hit me up in [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/gandalfill0) for a game!)

On my less _nerdy_ side, I follow basketball, mainly the NBA, and I've participated a variety of sports since High-school: Basketball, Tennis, Judo, Swimming, Table Tennis, Kayak polo. I've recently started doing some horseriding!
