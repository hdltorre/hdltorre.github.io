* I like movies, specially **going** to the movies. It took my a while to do this top 5. I have too many good movies in mind!:
    * Pulp Fiction (Add any other Tarantino movie to the list too)
    * Raiders of the lost Ark
    * Star wars (The original trilogy)
    * Blade Runner
    * Silence of the lambs

* I also watch quite a lot of TV-shows, specially sci-fi. My top 5:
    * Battlestar Galactica (2004)
    * Firefly 
    * Doctor who (Sometimes, I'm a moffat person...)
    * The leftovers
    * Hannibal

* I am a PC games enthusiast. I mainly play games for the story, with some exceptions. Some of my most treasured games (or series):
    * Monkey Island (1-3)
    * Grim Fandango
    * Souls games (all of them)
    * Mass effect 1-2-3 (Mainly 2)
    * Outer Wilds

* I'm an avid reader! I really can't do a top 5 here so I went with a top 10 and I had to think very hard about which ones to left out.
    * The lord of the rings & The Hobbit ( I'm counting them all as one)
    * A wizard of Earthsea, The tombs of Atuan and the farthest shore
    * Ender's game (Sequels are good too but the original has a special place in my heart)j
    * Dune and some sequels (Up to the point it gets really crazy... yeah, you know when)
    * The Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy (Ultimate edition with all of the novels)
    * The First law (first trilogy)
    * Sandman (Not technically a book :P)
    * Good omens
    * The road
    * Many (many) from Sir Terry Pratchett. Lets choose _Guards,Guards_ because it was my first Discworld novel
