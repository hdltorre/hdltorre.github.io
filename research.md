title: My research
subtitle: Particle physics with the ATLAS detector
---

I am an Experimental particle physics, which means I participate in experiments to measure and understand the wonderful world of elementary particles and their interactions.  

I am part of the [ATLAS Collaboration](https://atlas.cern/discover/collaboration) which brings together around 5 thousands physicists, engineers and technicians and support staff around the world to manage and operate the [ATLAS detector](https://atlas.cern/discover/detector), a massive particle detector build underground at [CERN](https://home.cern/) to measure the products of proton-proton collisions being produced at the [Large Hadron Collider (LHC)](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider).  

Although I started my career measuring known physics processes to high precision my current research is focused on searching for new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), the basic framework that captures our current knowledge of particle physics. In particular I spent most of my time as Research associate with Michigan State University leading searches with multiple third-generation quarks in the final state (top-quarks and b-quarks).  

I also participate in the upgrade programme of the ATLAS detector for the next era of LHC data taking, the [High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC)](https://hilumilhc.web.cern.ch/), to start in 2027. This improvement for the LHC will allow to achieve much larger instantaneous luminosities than the baseline LHC programme, enlarging the data sample available to the experiments by one order of magnitude. The ATLAS detector will need to undergo several modifications in order to maintain or improve its capabilities in the challenging HL-LHC conditions.
