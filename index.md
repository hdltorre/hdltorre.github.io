#### Welcome to my website! Here I collect some thoughts, interesting material and less interesting things about myself.

* I am a particle physicist working at the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva. You may find [my research](https://hdltorre.github.io/research/) interesting!
* If you want to know more about me, not only my research, visit the [About me](https://hdltorre.github.io/aboutme/) section
* I may write something on my [Blog](https://hdltorre.github.io/blog/) from time to time, although I don't promise anything
* You can also take a look at my latest [CV](https://hdltorre.github.io/cv/)
