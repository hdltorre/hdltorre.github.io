subtitle: PhD, Assistant Professor at Northern Illinois University

#### Welcome to my website! Here I collect some thoughts, interesting material and less interesting things about myself.

My name is Hector de la Torre Perez. I am an Assistant professor at Northern Illinois University (NIU), where I teach physics courses. I am a particle physicist working on the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). My team and I analyze the wealth of data recorded by the ATLAS detector, searching for hints of new particles not predicted by the standard model of particle physics. If you find that intriguing, you may want to learn more about my research.

I'm Spanish (born in Madrid) and have lived in Switzerland for many years before making my way to Illinois. If I'm not in Dekalb, I'm likely at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, working with other ATLAS physicists from around the globe in physics analysis, taking care of the ATLAS detector, or preparing the ATLAS experiment for the upcoming upgrade of the LHC; the High-Luminosity LHC.

I studied physics and completed an MSc in theoretical physics at Universidad Autonoma de Madrid on the outskirts of the Spanish capital city. After that, I moved to Geneva to be closer to the experiment and finished my PhD at the same institution in 2016. Before arriving at NIU in 2023, I was a postdoctoral research associate at Michigan State University. If you want more details, my CV has them in spades.
Beyond physics, I enjoy reading (especially fantasy and science fiction), playing computer games, and going to the movies!
